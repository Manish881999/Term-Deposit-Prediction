# Term Deposit Prediction

## Problem Setting:
A Banking institution conducted marketing campaigns through phone calls to promote term deposits among existing customers.  Because they enable companies to target specific client groups with specialized promotions and offers, direct marketing initiatives like phone call campaigns are crucial for businesses. The bank's goal was to retain customers and increase revenue from term deposit products. The bank may be able to enhance term deposit product sales and client retention by using this kind of promotion. Additionally, the bank can gain valuable insights into customer behavior client behavior, and preferences through data analysis of these campaigns, which can help it make smarter judgments for future marketing initiatives. Overall, running marketing campaigns is essential to the success of a business since it helps to both attract and keep customers.

## Problem Definition:
Based on past data gathered from direct marketing efforts that were carried out via phone calls, the objective of this project is to forecast whether a client of the Banking institution would subscribe to a term deposit.

## Data Sources:
The dataset has been taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository, an open-source repository for research data (https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing). The data is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a banking institution.

## Data Description:
The data provided contains information on 41188 customers and 20 input variables. The input variables include information on the customer's age, job, marital status, education, default status, housing, and personal loan status, last contact month and day of the week, duration of the last call, number of contacts performed during the campaign, number of days since the last contact, the outcome of the previous campaign, employment variation rate, consumer price index, consumer confidence index, Euribor 3-month rate, and number of employees. The target variable, 'y', is a binary variable indicating whether the client subscribed to a term deposit or not.
